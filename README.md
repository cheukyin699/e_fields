# Electric Fields (e_fields.py)

e_fields, an interactive visualizer for 2D electric fields.


## Requirements
- python2
- pygame


## Features

Visualizations for electric fields, with lots and lots of customizability! Most
things are (hopefully) constants, and aren't hard-wired, meaning you could
change anything from the way it gets displayed to the background colour.

## Controls

### Adding a charge

To add a charge, left click on the screen. Note that you can not add a charge
with strength = 0.


### Removing a charge

To remove a charge, right click close to the charge on the screen.


### Removing all charges

Press 'c' on your keyboard to remove all charges (sounds like some kind of
futuristic courthouse).


### Changing strength of charge

Pressing the up arrow increases the strength of the charge by a factor of 1
while pressing the down arrow decreases it by 1
